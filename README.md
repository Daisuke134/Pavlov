# Pavlov

## Overview
Pavlov is a real-time feedback app that uses EEG data from Muse 2 to make you more mindful. It detects when your mind drifts and provides a brief beep to refocus you, helping you stay present and aware.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Daisuke134/NF_MUSE.git
   ```  
2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```bash   
   cd NF_MUSE
   ``` 
3. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ``` 
## Running the Predictions
To start making real-time predictions, run:
   ```bash
   python predict.py
   ``` 
â€»Make sure your Muse device is connected and streaming data.

## Training and Evaluation
If you wish to evaluate the model's performance or retrain it with new data, follow these steps:

1. Download the training data CSV:
   ```bash
   curl -L -o training_data/01-18--22-41-05.csv "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1InAOM7XTEpIAwKFhyzCfsYTwFx0rgFnz"
   ```
2. Generate training data text file from CSV:
   ```bash   
   python data.py
   ```
3. Train and evaluate the Random Forest model(This will use the generated text file to train the model and output its performance metrics):
   ```bash 
   python model.py
   ```
